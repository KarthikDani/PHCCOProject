# GSSM 
## An Open Source Tool for Building and Analysing Context Specific Metabolic Models and Generate visualisations.

## Overview

GSMM is a Python-based toolkit for Genome Scale Metabolic Modeling, designed for [currently] analyzing and visualizing metabolic models during my PHCCO Internship, specifically tailored for integrating transcriptomics based expression data and conducting nutrient depletion studies [ongoing]. It utilizes computational biology techniques to analyze flux distributions, reaction deletions, and sink fluxes across context-specific metabolic models.

## Features

- **Model Integration:** Create Context Specific Metabolic Models with easy to use functions
- **Flux Analysis:** Analyze and visualize flux distributions and correlations between metabolic models.
- **Reaction Deletion Analysis:** Conduct reaction deletion studies and visualize results using cluster maps.
- **Sink Flux Analysis:** Analyze and visualize sink fluxes for metabolites of interest.
- **Visualization:** Generate high-quality plots for presentation and analysis.
